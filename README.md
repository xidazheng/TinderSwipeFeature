This first version demonstrates how the draggable view in Tinder can be implemented. 

The purpose was to learn about UIViews properties, CGAffineTransforms, and animations. 

The code is pretty messy, hacked together over a weekend. Future work will include refactoring the code to make a custom draggable UIView class.
